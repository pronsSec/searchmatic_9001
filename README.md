# searchmatic_9001
This will search all files in a directory in parallel for a search phrase you input.  It will infer the file"s source lang and translate your phrase to that language.  At the end it will translate the files to English.  Yeah motherfucker, and it is fast as fuck. Well, relatively fast for what it is doing.
